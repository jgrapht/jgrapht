/**
 * An implementation of Bhandari algorithm for finding $K$ edge-<em>disjoint</em> shortest paths.
 * The algorithm determines the $k$ edge-disjoint shortest simple paths in increasing order of
 * weight. Weights can be negative (but no negative cycle is allowed). Only directed simple graphs
 * are allowed.
 *
 * <p>
 * The algorithm is running $k$ sequential Bellman-Ford iterations to find the shortest path at each
 * step. Hence, yielding a complexity of $k$*O(Bellman-Ford).
 * <p>
 * In contrast to BhandariKDisjointShortestPaths, this implementation maintains an internal shortest path tree,
 * that is incrementally updated (tree grafting).
 * For sparse graphs or graphs where the shortest path tree resembles the k-shortest paths, this provides a significant
 * speedup. In the worst case, this implementation should perform equally to BhandariKDisjointShortestPaths.

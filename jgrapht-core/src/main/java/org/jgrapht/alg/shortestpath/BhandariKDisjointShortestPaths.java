/**
 * An implementation of Bhandari algorithm for finding K edge-<em>disjoint</em> shortest paths.
 * The algorithm determines the k disjoint shortest simple paths in increasing order of
 * weight. Weights can be negative (but no negative cycle is allowed). Only directed simple graphs
 * are allowed.
 *
 * <p>
 * The algorithm is running k sequential Bellman-Ford iterations to find the shortest path at each step.
 * Hence, yielding a complexity of k*O(Bellman-Ford).
 *

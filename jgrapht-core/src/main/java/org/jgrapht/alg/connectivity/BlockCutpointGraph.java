/**
 * A Block-Cutpoint graph (also known as a block-cut tree).
 * If $G$ is a graph, the block-cutpoint graph of $G$, denoted $BC(G)$ is the simple bipartite graph with
 * bipartition $(A, B)$ where $A$ is the set of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArticulationVertex.html">cut-vertices</a> (also known as articulation points) of $G$,
 * and $B$ is the set of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Block.html">blocks</a> of $G$. $BC(G)$ contains an edge $(a,b)$ for $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ if and only if
 * block $b$ contains the cut-vertex $a$.
 * A vertex in $G$ is a cut-vertex if removal of the vertex from $G$ (and all edges incident to this vertex) increases
 * the number of connected components in the graph. A block of $G$ is a maximal connected subgraph $H \subseteq G$ so
 * that $H$ does not have a cut-vertex. Note that if $H$ is a block, then either $H$ is 2-connected, or $|V(H)| \leq 2$.
 * Each pair of blocks of $G$ share at most one vertex, and that vertex is a cut-point in $G$. $BC(G)$ is a tree in which
 * each leaf node corresponds to a block of $G$.
 * <p>
 * This class also computes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(graph_theory)">bridges</a> (also know as cut-edges) in a graph.
 * A bridge is an edge of a graph whose deletion increases its number of connected components.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm implemented in this class to compute the BLock-Cutpoint graph is described in:
 * Hopcroft, J. Tarjan, R. Algorithm 447: efficient algorithms for graph manipulation, 1973. Communications of the ACM. 16 (6): 372â€“378.
 * This implementation runs in linear time $O(|V|+|E|)$ and is based on Depth-first search.
 * More information about this subject be be found in this wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component">article</a>.
